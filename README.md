# 1tempvm
create temporary digital ocean droplets from the command line

---

Requires:
- tugboat
- server with atd and curl, accessible via ssh(keys preferably)

---
I've had this function sitting in my bashrc for forever and had since forgotten about it.

Basically you specify your DO details, and a server running atd, and you can easily create self-destructing DO droplets with one command.

Used for testing random jank.
